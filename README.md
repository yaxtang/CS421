# UIUC CS412 Compiler and Programming Language
MPs and activities in summer 2017
## Reference
Link: https://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters
## Goal 
- Write recursive functions and definitions.
- Implement some set-theoretic functionality using Haskell lists.
- Use higher-order functions to compactly represent common code patterns.
- Use and write Algebraic Data Types (ADTs) with some associated operators.
- Learn how to use Hash Maps in Haskell
- Be able to manually translate a chunk of simple functional code into CPS.
- Write some functions which can automatically translate simple functional code into CPS.
- Understand the basic syntax of Scheme and how to evaluate programs in it
- Understand how to simulate stateful computation by composing monads, and write seemingly imperative but under-the-hood functional code in Haskell
- Create an REPL for your interpreter which handles manipulating the environment based on inputs from the user
- Understand homoiconicity and metacircular evaluation via Scheme

  ## Practice
  -  build an interpreter for a minimalist dialect of Lisp called Scheme.
  -  Implement a stack-based language. Such languages are often useful for embedded systems. (Postscript, the printer language, is an example.) The language we will implement is called Forth.
  -  Write an interpreter for a language with both expressions and statements.
