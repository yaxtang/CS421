Logistics
---------

-   release date: July 24, 2017
-   due date: August 3, 2017 NOON - No later submissions!

Objectives
----------

The objective for this MP is to build an interpreter for a minimalist dialect of
Lisp called Scheme. You will learn to build a fully monadic evaluator, and a
read-evaluate-print-loop (REPL) to accept input from user.

This language will have the normal things you would expect in a Lisp-like
language, such as functions, numbers, symbols, and lists. You will also write a
macro system and explore how to use it. Macros give you the ability to program
your programming language, redefining it to be anything you want.

Goals
-----

-   Understand the basic syntax of Scheme and how to evaluate programs in it
-   Understand how to simulate stateful computation by composing monads, and
    write seemingly imperative but under-the-hood functional code in Haskell
-   Create an REPL for your interpreter which handles manipulating the
    environment based on inputs from the user
-   Understand homoiconicity and metacircular evaluation via Scheme

Getting Started
===============

Relevant Files
--------------

In the directory `app/`, you will find the program code, some of which is only
partially implemented, and which you will have to modify to complete this
assignment. The file `test/Tests.hs` contains the code used for testing.

Running Code
------------

As usual, you have to run `stack init` (you only need to do this once).

To run your code, start GHCi with `stack ghci` (make sure to load the `Main`
module if `stack ghci` doesn't automatically do it). From here, you can test
individual functions, or you can run the REPL by calling `main`. Note that the
initial `$` and `>` are prompts.

``` {.sh}
$ stack ghci
 ... More Output ...
Prelude> :l Main
Ok, modules loaded: Main.
*Main> main
```

To run the REPL directly, build the executable with `stack build` and run it
with `stack exec main`.

Testing Your Code
-----------------

You are able to run the test-suite with `stack test`:

``` {.sh}
$ stack test
```

It will tell you which test-suites you pass, fail, and have exceptions on. To
see an individual test-suite (so you can run the tests yourself by hand to see
where the failure happens), look in the file `test/Spec.hs`.

You can run individual test-sets by running `stack ghci` and loading the `Spec`
module with `:l Spec`. Then you can run the tests (specified in `test/Tests.hs`)
just by using the name of the test:

Look in the file `test/Tests.hs` to see which tests were run.

### Environment

Like previous assignments, the environment is a `HashMap`. You can access
functions like `lookup`, `union` and `insert` through prefix `H`, such as: `H.lookup`

``` {.haskell}
type Env = H.HashMap String Val
```

### Abstract Syntax Tree

Now we offer you the Scheme AST. From your previous experience, do you notice anything unusual? 

``` {.haskell}
data Val = Symbol String
         | Boolean Bool
         | Number Int
         | DottedList [Val] Val
         | List [Val]
         | PrimFunc ([Val] -> EvalState Val)  -- Primitive function,
                                              --   implemented in Haskell
         | Func [String] Val Env              -- Closure
         | Macro [String] Val                 -- Macro
         | Void                               -- No value
```

That's right, the AST data type is `Val`, not `Exp`! Scheme, as well as other
Lisps, is a homoiconic language, meaning that the text of the language and the
values have the same structure as its AST. 

> Code is data. Data is code.

Expressions from the programmer are now encoded as values: numbers, booleans, symbols
and lists. When you feed such a value to the evaluator, the evaluator treats it
as an expression and evaluates it!

Now we'll describe what the different values mean, and provide some examples.

 

### Kinds of values

1. `Symbol`
 
    Symbol is just a symbol. In previous MPs, a symbol expression, a.k.a.
    `SymExp`, was meant to be evaluated as a variable name bound to a value. In
    Scheme, this is no longer the case. Not only can you have values bound to a
    symbol, you can also use symbols themselves as a value.
  
2. `Boolean`

    Can be true `#t` or false `#f`.
  
3. `Number`
   
    An integer. We do not support floating point in this MP.
    
4. `List`

    A `List` (that is, a "proper" Scheme list; keep reading!) is a list of values
    terminated by an empty proper list. Scheme _theoretically_ would define lists using
    _pairs_ recursively, like this: a proper list would be a pair with a single item on the left
    and another proper list on the right. As a base case, there would be the special empty list `()`,
    which might be called "nil" or "null". However, we can get a speed advantage by simply
    using Haskell's native lists to implement our version of Scheme lists.

    In Scheme syntax, a proper list could be created like `(1 2 3)` or equivalently
    like `(1 . (2 . (3 . () )))` where the `.` is a pair separator.
  
5. `DottedList`

    Because Scheme theoretically uses pairs to make lists, we have a dilemma: what if the
    "list" isn't formed correctly as described above? A `DottedList` potentially represents
    an "improper" list of values: it can be ended by some _non-null_ tail value (e.g. `(1 2 . 3)`).
    This is theoretically what you would get in Scheme if you kept nesting pairs on the right side
    of pairs, but where the rightmost nested item was _not_ the empty list value, but some other value.
    In our implementation using Haskell, we make a type distinction between these "improper" dotted
    lists and the "proper" null-terminated lists, defining separate constructors: the `DottedList`
    constructor allows the trailing non-null value to be specified explicitly.

    This distinction allows us to utilize Haskell's native list data structure for better
    performance. This will also simplify our implementation of some other Scheme routines.

    However, because `DottedList` might be used to provide a null list as the trailing
    value, lists and dotted lists that are constructed differently can be equivalent by value.
    We offer you a useful helper function, `flattenList`, which flattens a `DottedList` to the
    simplest form; the flattening may simplify a dotted list to a proper list if possible,
    to a non-list singleton type, or to a simpler improper list that's still dotted.
    You will find it
    extremely useful when implementing primitive functions in the runtime, and you may want
    to use `flattenList` whenever you are trying to do Haskell pattern matching on a Scheme list.
    (That includes cases where you're passing a Scheme list to a Haskell function that has
    multiple definitions! Remember, in Haskell, that does pattern matching.)

    For example, here are the results of flattening some proper and improper lists.
    When the left of the dot is blank, the right hand side is flattened recursively.
    The fourth example is an improper list, so it remains a dotted list after flattening.

    | Nested               | Flattened   |
    |----------------------|-------------|
    | `( . ( . 3 ))`       | `3`         |
    | `( . ())`            | `()`        |
    | `(1 . ())`           | `(1)`       |
    | `(1 . (2 . 3))`      | `(1 2 . 3)` |
    | `(1 . (2 . 3 . ()))` | `(1 2 3)`   |
    | `(1 . (2 3))`        | `(1 2 3)`   |

6. `PrimFunc`

    A primitive function is a function defined in Haskell, lifted to Scheme. The
    type constructor `PrimFunc` takes a function that takes an argument list and
    returns an evaluation state, encapsulating either both the result of
    evaluation and the environment, or a `Diagnostic` thrown along the
    computation.

7. `Func`

    A closure has an argument list, a body, and a captured environment. 

    As a side note, we are not implementing the reference memory model for Scheme.
    Thus functions are passed by value, i.e. all variables of the closure
    environment will be copied upon the copy of a closure.

8. `Macro`

    A macro has an argument list and a body. The body will be first transformed to
    an expanded body by the evaluator, and the expanded body gets fed back into
    the evaluator again. We'll talk about it in detail in the evaluation section.

9. `Void`

    The evaluator returns a value for every expression. Void is a special return
    type of the `(define ...)` and `(define-macro ...)` special forms. It does not
    represent any data.

### Example ASTs for Values

This table illustrates how some Scheme expressions are represented using our AST constructors
of `Val` type.
You can see how these are parsed for you in the `app/Scheme/Parse.hs` file.
The quote expressions are explained later in the MP.

| Scheme expression  | Haskell AST representation                                          |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `1`                | `Number 1`                                                          |
| `a`                | `Symbol "a"`                                                        |
| `#t`               | `Boolean True`                                                      |
| `#f`               | `Boolean False`                                                     |
| `(define (f x) x)` | `List [Symbol "define", List [Symbol "f",`                          |
| &nbsp;             | &nbsp;&nbsp;`Symbol "x"], Symbol "x"]`                              |
| `'1`               | `List [Symbol "quote", Number 1]`                                   |
| `` `,a  ``         | `List [Symbol "quasiquote",`                                        |
| &nbsp;             | &nbsp;&nbsp;`List [Symbol "unquote",  Symbol "a"]]`                 |
    
### Diagnostic

  You are given a fully defined `Diagnostic` type, cases of which are runtime
  errors thrown along evaluation. You are responsible for choosing the right
  `Diagnostic` to throw, in your evaluator.
  
``` {.haskell}
data Diagnostic = UnexpectedArgs [Val]
                | TypeError Val
                | NotFuncError Val
                | UndefSymbolError String
                | NotArgumentList Val
                | InvalidSpecialForm String Val
                | CannotApply Val [Val]
                | InvalidExpression Val
                | NotASymbol Val
                | NotAListOfTwo Val
                | UnquoteNotInQuasiquote Val
                | Unimplemented String
```

### Evaluation State

  At the end of `Scheme/Core.hs`, we defined for you the type of the evaluation state
  monad, `EvalState a`, where `a` is the type of the evaluation result.

``` {.haskell}
type EvalState a = StateT Env (Except Diagnostic) a
```

  `StateT` is the monad transformer version of `State`. But you do not need to
  fully understand monad transformers! Simply read the declaration above as:
  `EvalState` is a state encapsulating the evaluation result of type `a` and the
  environment of type `Env`, except when a `Diagnostic` is thrown along the
  evaluation.
  
  Unlike evaluators you have previously written in this course, the Scheme
  evaluator will *look like imperative code*. Under the hood, the `do` notation
  is doing function composition. The following example is part of the evaluator
  of the `define` special form for functions:

``` {.haskell}
do -- Save the current environment
  env <- get 
  -- Create closure value
  val <- (\argVal -> Func argVal body env) <$> mapM getSym args
  -- Modify environment
  modify $ H.insert fname val
  -- Return void
  return Void
```

  In order to work with the `EvalState` monad, you will use the following
  library functions. To explain briefly, because of how we defined our `EvalState`
  with `StateT`, `EvalState` is also an instance of some library typeclasses that
  provide us with these functions:

``` {.haskell}
-- Return the state from the internals of the monad.
get :: EvalState Env
  
-- Specify a new state to replace the state inside the monad.
put :: Env -> EvalState ()
  
-- Monadic state transformer. Taking a function as its argument, it converts
-- the old state to a new state inside the state monad. The old state is lost.
modify :: (Env -> Env) -> EvalState ()
  
-- Used within a monadic computation to begin exception processing. We'll use
-- it to throw `Diagnostic` errors and still return an `EvalState`.
throwError :: Diagnostic -> EvalState a
```
  
### Terminology

1. Value
   
    A value is just a `Val`. It's sometimes referred to as "datum".
   
2. Self-evaluating

    We call a datum self-evaluating if it always evaluates to itself. `Number` and
    `Boolean` are self-evaluating.

3. Form

    A form is a Scheme datum (`Val`) that is also a program, that is, it can be
    fed into the evaluator. It can be a self-evaluating value, a symbol, or a list.

4. Special form

    A special form is a form with special syntax and special evaluation rules,
    possibly manipulating the evaluation environment, control flow, or both.
   
5. Macro

    A macro is a form that stands for another form. An application of macro may
    look like a function application, but it goes through macro expansion first
    to get translated to the form it stands for, and then the expanded form will
    be evaluated.
   
6. Diagnostic

    A diagnostic is a run time error thrown along evaluation.

Problems
=================

Caution
---------

We recommend reading through the _entire_ instructions PDF before beginning.
Also, the notation may not appear correctly in the `.md` file, so please do
read the PDF.

If you encounter an “unimplemented” error when evaluating a scheme expression in the examples,
do not worry. It's up to you to go ahead and implement it, or keep following the order of the handout.
You'll eventually implement these features, but you may have to go back and forth.

Execution
----------

### Problem 1. REPL

You'll have to fill in parts of the REPL function from `Main.hs`, implementing
cases for each of the possible results of evaluation. `repl :: Env -> IO ()`. 

Our call to the function `runExcept` returns type `Either Diagnostic (Val, Env)`,
where the `Either` type's `Right` pair represents the result value and new environment.

``` {.haskell}
repl :: Env -> IO ()
repl env = do
  putStr "scheme> "
  l <- getLine                                        -- Read
  case parse exprP "Expression" l of                  -- Parse
    Left err -> print err                             -- Diagnostics
    Right expr ->
      case runExcept $ runStateT (eval expr) env of   -- Eval
        -- TODO:
        -- Insert line here: If error, print error
        -- Insert line here: If return value is void,
        --                    loop with new env without printing
        -- Insert line here: Otherwise, print and loop with new env
        --
        -- The following line may be removed when you're done implementing
        --  the cases above:
        _ -> print "Error in Main.hs: Finish implementing repl"
  repl env                                            -- Loop with old env
```

We've provided a `main` function for you, which just calls your `repl` with
`runtime` as the initial environment. The `runtime` environment is explained
further below.

``` {.haskell}
main :: IO ()
main = repl runtime
```

To start the REPL, run `stack ghci`, then call `main`.

```
$ stack ghci
[1 of 4] Compiling Scheme.Core (...)
[2 of 4] Compiling Scheme.Eval (...)
[3 of 4] Compiling Scheme.Parse (...)
[4 of 4] Compiling Scheme.Runtime (...)
[5 of 5] Compiling Main (...)
*Main Scheme.Core Scheme.Eval Scheme.Parse Scheme.Runtime> main
scheme>
```

We do not automatically test your REPL in the test cases! As a sanity check,
the following should work even if you haven't done the rest of the MP yet.
These inputs correspond to catching an error, evaluating to a void,
and evaluating to some other value:

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (define (f x))
Error: Invalid pattern in special form `define`: (define (f x))
scheme> (define (f x) (1))
scheme> `(3 . 3)
(3 . 3)
```

After you implement the evaluator and runtime, all sorts of inputs
should work:

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (cons 'monad '(is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors))
(monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors)
```

Evaluation
-----------

### Evaluator

Here we will write and test our evaluator.

#### Problem 2. Integer & Boolean, the self-evaluating primitives

`Integer` and `Boolean` evaluate to themselves. They are examples of expressions
in "normal form". When an expression evaluates, the goal is to continually
evaluate it further, until it reaches a normal form.

About the notation: when $n$ is evaluated in environment $\sigma$, the result is $n$
and the environment remains the same $\sigma$.

$$ [\![ n \mid \sigma ]\!] \Downarrow \langle n \mid \sigma \rangle $$

$$ [\![ \texttt{\#t} \mid \sigma ]\!] \Downarrow \langle \texttt{\#t} \mid \sigma \rangle $$

$$ [\![ \texttt{\#f} \mid \sigma ]\!] \Downarrow \langle \texttt{\#f} \mid \sigma \rangle $$

#### Problem 3. Symbol

`Symbol` evaluates to the value that it is bound to in the current environment.

Here, our notation may simply show a `Diagnostic` being returned in place of a value.

$$ \frac{(s \mapsto v) \in \sigma}{ [\![ s \mid \sigma ]\!] \Downarrow \langle v \mid \sigma \rangle } $$

$$ \frac{(s \mapsto v) \notin \sigma}{ [\![ s \mid \sigma ]\!] \Downarrow \langle \texttt{UndefSymbolError} \mid \sigma \rangle } $$

#### Problem 4. Special form `define` for variables

Now we want to allow the user to define variables. The variable definition form
is `(define var exp)` (an s-expression). `var` must be a `Symbol`. The evaluator
will evaluate `exp` and insert to the environment the value as a binding for the
symbol. Use `modify` to mutate the state. In our notation, $\sigma$ is the original
environment, $\sigma'$ is an environment that _may_ have been modified recursively,
and finally we use substitution notation to show $\sigma'$ gets updated with the
new binding for $x$.

$$
    \frac{{[\![e \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ } \langle v \mid \sigma' \rangle }
         {{[\![(\texttt{define}\ x\ e) \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }{\langle \texttt{Void} \mid \sigma' [x \mapsto v ] \rangle}}
$$

$~$

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (define a (+ 10 20))
scheme> a
30
scheme> b
Error: Symbol b is undefined
```

(In _real_ Scheme, you're not allowed to have nested `define`, but we don't check for that.
For fun, you could try to use our version of the semantics to do something weird.)

#### Problem 5a. Special form `define` for named functions

We've already given you the ability to define functions. This has the form
`(define (f params) body)`. The parameters, body, and environment when the
function is declared get wrapped into a `Func` value. It uses `get` to retrieve
the environment from the state monad, and `modify` to mutate the state. A `Func`
value is also a normal form.

The semantics for this can be given as follows. The notation $valid(p_1 \cdots p_n)$ means that
parameters $p_1 \cdots p_n$ (such as might be labeled `x y z` in `f x y z`, for example) must
be a proper list of `Symbol`s, implemented with type `List`&nbsp;`[Symbol]`.

<!---
$$ ps = p_1 \cdots p_n \qquad $$

  $${\sigma}' = {\sigma}{\ \cup\ }\{f \mapsto {\texttt{Func}}\ ps\ e\ {\sigma}'\} $$
-->

$$
    \frac
    {valid(p_1 \cdots p_n)}
    {{[\![(\texttt{define}\ (f\ p_1 \cdots p_n)\ e) \mid {\sigma}]\!]}
      \Downarrow \langle \texttt{Void} \mid \sigma [ f \mapsto {\texttt{Func}}\ p_1 \cdots p_n\ e\ \sigma ] \rangle}
$$

$$
    \frac
    {\lnot\, valid(p_1 \cdots p_n)}
    {{[\![(\texttt{define}\ (f\ p_1 \cdots p_n)\ e) \mid {\sigma}]\!]}
      \Downarrow \langle \texttt{NotASymbol} \mid \sigma \rangle}
$$

$~$

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (define x 1)
scheme> (define (inc y) (+ y x))
scheme> inc
#<function:(λ (y) ...)>
scheme> (inc 10)
11
scheme> (define x 2)
scheme> (define (add x y) (+ x y))
scheme> (add 3 4)
7
scheme> (define (fact n) (cond ((< n 1) 1) (else (* n (fact (- n 1))))))
scheme> (fact 5)
120
```

Note that named functions in Scheme can be used recursively. This isn't because
of the binding semantics given here, but because of the mechanism by which they are applied.
There is more detail later in this document.

#### Problem 5b. Special form `lambda` for anonymous function expressions

You also need to implement a lambda-function form, `(lambda (params) body)`,
which also evaluates to a `Func`. The lambda creates an anonymous function to be
used as a value, and it does _not_ automatically bind it to a name in the environment.

$$ \frac
   {valid(p_1 \cdots p_n)}
   {[\![(\texttt{lambda}\ (p_1 \cdots p_n)\ e) \mid \sigma]\!] {\ \Downarrow \ } \langle {\texttt{Func}}\ p_1 \cdots p_n\ e\ {\sigma} \mid \sigma \rangle}
$$

<!-- old
$$ {[\![(\texttt{lambda}\ (p_1 \cdots p_n)\ e) \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }{\texttt{Func}}\ p_1 \cdots p_n\ e\ {\sigma}{\ \bigm\vert \ }valid(p_1 \cdots p_n) $$
-->

$$ \frac
   {\lnot\, valid(p_1 \cdots p_n)}
   {[\![(\texttt{lambda}\ (p_1 \cdots p_n)\ e) \mid \sigma]\!] {\ \Downarrow \ } \langle \texttt{NotASymbol} \mid \sigma \rangle}
$$

<!-- old
$$ {[\![(\texttt{lambda}\ (p_1 \cdots p_n)\ e) \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }{\texttt{NotASymbol}} {\ \bigm\vert \ }\lnot\, valid(p_1 \cdots p_n) $$
-->

$~$

In usage, a lambda expression could be applied immediately where it is written:

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (lambda (x) (+ x 10))
#<function:(λ (x) ...)>
scheme> ((lambda (x) (+ x 10)) 20)
30
```

Or, a lambda expression could be explicitly bound to a name in the environment
using `define`. You can even parameterize it by supplying additional parameters
with the `define`:

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (define (incBy x) (lambda (y) (+ x y)))
scheme> (define i2 (incBy 2))
scheme> (i2 10)
12
```

This partially allows for currying. However, direct application of such
functions still must obey the proper nesting of parentheses:

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (incBy 2 10)
Error: Cannot apply #<function:(λ (x) ...)> on argument list (2 10)
scheme> ((incBy 2) 10)
12
```

#### Problem 6. Special form `cond`

We should have some sort of if expression, because that's useful. Define the
`(cond (c1 e1) ... (cn en))` form. If `c1` is not false, then `e1` is evaluated.
If it's false the next condition should be tried.

The last condition, `cn`, can optionally be symbol `else`. The expression
following `else` will be evaluated when all previous conditions evaluate to
false. If `else` appears in one of the conditions that is not the last
condition, it's an invalid special form (throw an error). If conditions are not
exhaustive, i.e. when all conditions evaluate to false, return `Void`.

Note that you are given the function `getListOf2` in `Eval.hs` which can be used
to verify that a Scheme list has length of two, and then returns a Haskell pair.

<!---

#### Problem 7. Special form `let`

Define the `(let ((x1 e1) ... (xn en)) body)` form. The definitions made in
`((x1 e1) ... (xn en))` should be added using *simultaneous assignment* to the
environment that `body` is evaluated in. You'll need to check that the
expressions being bound (the `(x1 e1) ... (xn en)`) are well-formed (they are a
form with two entries, the first being a variable name).

Note that in `Eval.hs` you are given a function `getBinding` which checks if
a single $(x_i\ e_i)$ clause of a `let` or `let*` is a proper list where the
first element is a symbol, which is evaluated to a `String`; then, it evaluates
the second element to a `Val`, and returns a Haskell tuple of type `(String, Val)`.

$$
    \frac{{[\![e_1 \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }v_1 \cdots {[\![e_n \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }v_n
            \qquad {[\![e_{\textrm{body}} \mid {\sigma}{\ \cup\ }\bigcup_{i=1}^n \{x_i \mapsto v_i\}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }v}
         {{[\![(\texttt{let}\ ((x_1\ e_1) \cdots (x_n\ e_n))\ e_{\textrm{body}}) \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }v}
$$

$~$

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (let ((x 5) (y 10)) (+ x y))

scheme> (define y 30)
scheme> (let ((x 11) (y 4)) (- (* x y) 2))
42
scheme> x
20
scheme> y
30
```


#### Problem 8. Special form `let*`

Define the `(let* ((x1 e1) ... (xn en)) body)` form. 

Special form `let*` is like `let`, but evaluates $e_1,\,\ldots,\,e_n$ one by one,
creating a location for each id as soon as the value is available. The ids are
bound in the remaining binding expressions as well as the body, and the ids
need not be distinct; later bindings shadow earlier bindings. (The notation
$\sigma [x \mapsto v]$ shows an update to environment $\sigma$.)

$$
    \frac{{[\![e_{\textrm{body}} \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }v}
         {{[\![(\texttt{let*}\ ()\ e_{\textrm{body}}) \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }v}

            }
         {{[\![(\texttt{let*}\ ((x_1\ e_1) \cdots (x_n\ e_n))\ e_{\textrm{body}}) \mid {\sigma}]\!]} {\ \Downarrow \ }v}
         \textrm{\quad where $n\geq 1$}
$$

#### Problem 9. Special forms `quote`, `quasiquote` and `unquote`

The special form `quote` returns its single argument, as written, without
evaluating it. This provides a way to include constant symbols and lists, which
are not self-evaluating objects, in a program. 

The special form `quasiquote` allows you to quote a value, but selectively
evaluate elements of that list. In the simplest case, it is identical to the
special form `quote`. However, when there is a form of pattern `(unquote ...)`
within a `quasiquote` context, the single argument of the `unquote` form gets
evaluated.

As a homoiconic language, most of Scheme's syntax is exactly the same as the AST
representation. There are, however, three special tokens in the *read syntax*
(human-readable, to be desugared by the parser to Scheme AST as the internal
representation) as a syntactic sugar for quoting, quasi-quoting and unquoting.
You do not need to implement the desugaring since it's handled by our parser.

- `'form` is equivalent to `(quote form)`
- `` `form`` is equivalent to `(quasiquote form)`
- `,form` is equivalent to `(unquote form)`

``` {.scheme}
scheme> 'a
a
scheme> '5
5
scheme> (quote a)
a
scheme> '*first-val*
*first-val*
scheme> ''a
(quote a)
scheme> (car (quote (a b c)))

scheme> (car '(a b c))
a
scheme> (car ''(a b c))
quote
scheme> '(2 3 4)

scheme> '( (+ 2 3))

scheme> (eval (eval ''(+ 1 2)))

scheme> (define a '(+ x 1))
scheme> (define x 5)
scheme> (eval a)
6
scheme> (define a 5)
scheme> ``(+ ,,a 1)

scheme> ``(+ ,,a ,a)
(quasiquote (+ (unquote 5) (unquote a)))
scheme> `(+ a ,,a)
Error: `unquote` not in a `quasiquote context: (unquote (unquote a))`
scheme> ``(+ a ,,a)
(quasiquote (+ a (unquote 5)))
scheme> (eval ``(+ ,,a 1))
(+ 5 1)
scheme> (eval (eval ``(+ ,,a 1)))
6
```

#### Problem 10. Special form `define-macro`

Define the `(define-macro (f params) exp)` form which defines a `Macro`. A `Macro`
is similar to a function: the key difference is not here in its definition binding,
but later in its application, where we actually do evaluation twice. First, we
evaluate the body of the macro, processing the arguments as frozen syntactic
pieces _without evaluating them individually_, getting a new syntax blob. Then,
we feed the result back into the evaluator to get the final result. In essence,
macros use lazy evaluation.

$$ ps = p_1 \cdots p_n $$

$$
    {[\![(\texttt{define-macro}\ (f \ ps)\ e) \mid {\sigma}]\!]}
    {\ \Downarrow \ }
    \langle \texttt{Void} \mid \sigma [ f \mapsto \texttt{Macro}\ ps\ e ] \rangle
    \quad\textrm{if }valid(ps)
$$

$$
    {[\![(\texttt{define-macro}\ (f \ ps)\ e) \mid {\sigma}]\!]}
    {\ \Downarrow \ }{\texttt{InvalidSpecialForm}}
    \quad\textrm{if }\lnot\, valid(ps)
$$

In your evaluator skeleton, we implemented a special form `if` for you, but it's
commented out. We do not need `if` as a special form because it can be defined
as a macro using `cond`!

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (define-macro (if con then else) `(cond (,con ,then) (else ,else)))
scheme> if
#<macro (con then else) ...>
scheme> (define a 5)
scheme> (if (> a 2) 10 20)
10
scheme> (if (< a 2) 10 20)
20
scheme> (define (fact n) (if (< n 1) 1 (* n (fact (- n 1)))))
scheme> (fact 10)
3628800
scheme> (define-macro (mkplus e) (if (eq? (car e) '-) (cons '+ (cdr e)) e))
scheme> (mkplus (- 5 4))
9
```

#### Problem 11. Application Form

If none of those forms were matched, then assume that the left-most part of the
form is to be applied to the rest of the arguments. The format is:

```scheme
(f arg1 ... argn)
```

Recall that the main distinction between macros and non-macros is that a macro
manipulates its arguments _at the syntax level_ before actually evaluating them.

1. Application when `f` is a macro

    1. Save the environment (Hint: use `get` to get the environment from the state)

    2. Bind arguments (without evaluating them) to the parameters of the
       macro and insert them to the environment (Hint: use `modify` to mutate the
       state)

    3. Evaluate the macro body (i.e. expand the macro body)

    4. Restore the environment we saved in step 1
   
    5. Evaluate the expanded form (the result of step 3) and return it
   
2. Application in other cases

    Instead of handling other application form directly in `eval`, you are going to
    implement it as a separate function `apply :: Val -> [Val] ->
    EvalState Val`. It takes an applicable value (`Func`, `PrimFunc`) and applies
    it to a list of arguments. The list of arguments passed to `apply` are
    assumed to have been already evaluated.

    In `eval`, we evaluate the arguments and pass them to `apply`.

    In `apply`, we are going to handle three cases of first argument:

    * If it's a `Func`:

        1. Save the environment

        2. Insert bindings of the closure environment to the current environment

        3. Bind arguments to the parameters of the function and insert them to
           the environment

        4. Evaluate the function body

        5. Restore the environment we saved in step 1

        6. Return the result of step 4

    * If it's a `PrimFunc`, we directly apply the primitive function to the
      argument list
     
    * Otherwise, throw a diagnostic `CannotApply`.

A note about recursion in Scheme: As you can see from the steps above,
when functions are applied, they get evaluated in an environment that _combines_
the bindings where the application occurs with the bindings stored in the closure.
That means a function can easily refer to itself. In some other languages, this is not
how recursion is implemented. What would happen if a function body could only be
evaluated in the closure environment?

Runtime Library
-----------------

The constant `runtime` is the initial runtime environment for the repl; it is a
map from `String` (identifiers) to `Val` (values). This will be used to hold the
values of defined constants, operators, and functions. The main call to `repl`
should provide this `runtime` as the starting environment. (It is also
possible to call `repl` with a different starting environment for experimental purposes.)
You can test your `runtime` using the REPL, so implement the REPL first!

You need to initialize `runtime` with predefined primitive operators as well.
This will make these operators available to users of your language. Some of them
have already been filled in, however you will need to implement the rest.

You will not be able to do this right away! Even the cases that have been
filled in use functions that are unimplemented. You'll need to implement a
variety of lifting functions and primitive functions first.

``` {.haskell}
runtime :: Env
runtime = H.fromList [ ("+", liftIntVargOp (+) 0)
                     , ("-", liftIntVargOp (-) 0)
                     , ("and", liftBoolVargOp and)
                     , ("or", liftBoolVargOp or)
                     , ("cons", PrimFunc cons)
                     , ("append", PrimFunc append)
                     , ("symbol?", PrimFunc isSymbol)
                     , ("list?", PrimFunc isList)
                     ]
```

We have provided the following translators to go between Scheme values and
Haskell values. These can help when defining the various operator lifters.
(Note that these take their single arguments in a Haskell list. See Problem 20
for more information.)

``` {.haskell}
-- Primitive function `symbol?` predicate
isSymbol :: [Val] -> EvalState Val
isSymbol [Symbol _] = return $ Boolean True
isSymbol [_] = return $ Boolean False
isSymbol vv = throwError $ UnexpectedArgs vv

-- Primitive function `list?` predicate
isList :: [Val] -> EvalState Val
isList [v] =
  return . Boolean $ case flattenList v of
    List _ -> True
    _ -> False
isList vv = throwError $ UnexpectedArgs vv
```

By the way, many of the provided stubs for the runtime problems use `const` to
create a curried function that will simply discard any provided parameter and
perform a stub action instead. For example,

``` {.haskell}
Prelude> foo x y = "please implement this function"
Prelude> foo 1 2
"please implement this function"
Prelude> foo = const . const $ "please implement this function"
Prelude> foo 1 2
"please implement this function"
```

### Operators

#### Problem 12. Variadic arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`): implement `liftIntVargOp`
_Note: In this release of the assignment, this function has already been provided for you._

You need to implement `liftIntVargOp` that takes an operator and a base-case. If
the supplied list of values is empty, then the base-case (lifted into the Scheme
world) is used. If it's non-empty, then the operator is applied between all the
elements of the list.

You should use `liftIntVargOp` to construct a `PrimFunc` for `+`, `-`, `*`, and
`/`, and put it in `runtime`.

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (+ 3 4 5)
12
scheme> (- 3 4 5)
-6
scheme> (-)
0
scheme> (+)
0
scheme> (* 3 5 9)
135
```

#### Problem 13. Variadic boolean operators (`and`, `or`): implement `liftBoolVargOp`

Unlike arithmetic operators which we have to apply pairwise to the list,
variadic boolean operators, `and` and `or`, are provided by Haskell
`Prelude`. You simply have to implement `liftBoolVargOp` to lift a function of
type `[Bool] -> Bool` to a `PrimFunc`.

Boolean rule of thumb: In Scheme, everything except `#f` is considered true.

Note that you'll need `eval` working on at least the quote form for these
examples and tests to work.

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (and #t #t #t 'nil)
#t
scheme> (and #t #t #t #f)
#f
scheme> (and)
#t
scheme> (or)
#f
scheme> (or 't #t)
#t
scheme> (or 'to-be 'not-to-be)
#t
scheme> (or #f #f #f #f)
#f
scheme> (and 3 2 5)
#t
scheme> (and 3 2 5 #f)
#f
scheme> (or 3 2 5)
#t
```

Add boolean operators `and` and `or` to your `runtime` environment. 

#### Problem 14. Binary comparison operators:

-   `>` Integer greater than
-   `<` Integer less than
-   `>=` Integer greater than or equal
-   `<=` Integer less than or equal

You should use `liftCompOp` for these. `liftCompOp` takes an integer comparison
function in Haskell and lifts it to a variadic Scheme comparison operator. If
the list is empty it should return Scheme's `True`, i.e. `Boolean True`. If the
list is larger, it should compare the elements of the list pair-wise using the
given operator and then logically `and` all of those together.

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (< 3 4 5)
#t
scheme> (>= 3 4 2)
#f
scheme> (>=)
#t
scheme> (>= 7)
#t
```

#### Problem 15. List operators

These are the functions for composing and decomposing lists. For historical background on the naming of these functions, you might want
to read this article:

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR_and_CDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAR_and_CDR)

-   `car :: [Val] -> EvalState Val`

    Get the first element of the list or dotted list (*single argument*)

-   `cdr :: [Val] -> EvalState Val`

    Get the rest of the list or dotted list (*single argument*)

-   `cons :: [Val] -> EvalState Val`: Construct a `DottedList` from *2 arguments*
-   `list :: [Val] -> EvalState Val`: Construct a `List` from as many arguments as given (hence it's *variadic*)

You must check the number of arguments, verify argument types, and throw
appropriate `Diagnostic`s on mismatch.

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (car)
Error: Unexpected arguments ()
scheme> (cdr)
Error: Unexpected arguments ()
scheme> (car '(3 5))
3
scheme> (cdr '(3 5 6 7))
(5 6 7)
scheme> (cdr '(3 5 . 6))
(5 . 6)
scheme> (cdr '(3 5 . (6 . 7)))
(5 6 . 7)
scheme> (list (> 3 4) #t 15 #f (< 5 2 3 5) (cons 3 (cons 4 3)))
(#f #t 15 #f #f (3 4 . 3))
scheme> (car (cons 'a 'b))
a
scheme> (cdr (cons 'a 'b))
b
scheme> (car (list 'a 'b 'c))
a
scheme> (cdr (list 'a 'b 'c))
(b c)
scheme> (cdr (list 'a))
()
scheme> (cdr 'a)
Error: Unexpected arguments (a)
scheme> (cons 2 (cons 3 4))
(2 3 . 4)
scheme> (cons 2 (cons 3 (cons 4 #f)))
(2 3 4 . #f)
scheme> (cons 4 (cons 2 (cons 1 '('cs421 'is 'easy . ()))))
(4 2 1 (quote cs421) (quote is) (quote easy))
```

We want to put these unary operators in our `runtime`, which means we'll need to
wrap them in a `PrimFunc`.

#### Problem 16. Unary boolean operator (`not`)

Implement `not` by lifting Haskell `not` with `liftBoolUnaryOp`: There must be exactly
one argument, or else it's an error. When applied to `#f`, `not` returns `#t`. In all
other cases, it returns `#f`.

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (not #t)
#f
scheme> (not #f)
#t
scheme> (not 'mattox)
#f
scheme> (not 'false)
#f
scheme> (not)
Error: Unexpected arguments ()
scheme> (not #f #t)
Error: Unexpected arguments (#f #t)
scheme> (not 'nil #t 3)
Error: Unexpected arguments (nil #t 3)
scheme> (not 3)
#f
```

#### Problem 17. Equality (`=`, `eq?`)

You will implement two variants of Scheme's equality:

* `=`

    Equality for numbers and booleans, throwing `TypeError` on type mismatch or unsupported types such as function

* `eq?`

    Equality for atom values, including numbers, booleans, and symbols, returning `#f` on type mismatch or unsupported types (not throwing diagnostics!)

Both `=` and `eq?` are variadic with default value `#t`. When the number of arguments is 0 or 1, these functions return `#t`
_regardless_ of the arguments' types or values.

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (=)
#t
scheme> (= #f)
#t
scheme> (= #t #f #t)
#f
scheme> (= 1 1)
#t
scheme> (= 3 3 2)
#f
scheme> (= 'a)
#t
scheme> (= 'a 'a)
Error: Value a has unexpected type Symbol
scheme> (eq? 3 3 2)
#f
scheme> (eq? 'a 'a)
#t
```

#### Problem 18. Modulo (`modulo`)

Implement the `modulo` function (a binary operator taking two integers, and
finding the remainder of one divided by the other, in accordance with Haskell's
`mod` operator). Use `liftIntBinOp`.

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (modulo)
Error: Unexpected arguments ()
scheme> (modulo 1)
Error: Unexpected arguments (1)
scheme> (modulo 1 5)
1
scheme> (modulo 5 1)
0
scheme> (modulo 5 2)
1
scheme> (modulo 6 (- 3))
0
scheme> (modulo (- 3) 1)
0
scheme> (modulo 7 (- 3))
-2
scheme> (modulo (- 7) 2)
1
scheme> (modulo 9 4)
1
```
#### Problem 19. Abs (`abs`)

Implement the `abs` function, which calculates the absolute value of the given
integer. Use `liftIntUnaryOp`.

``` {.scheme}
scheme> (abs)
Error: Unexpected arguments ()
scheme> (abs 1)
1
scheme> (abs 1 2)
Error: Unexpected arguments (1 2)
scheme> (abs (- 5))
5
```

#### Problem 20. Type Predicates (`symbol?`, `list?`, `pair?`, `number?`, `boolean?`, `null?`)

(Recall that a "predicate" is a function that returns a Boolean value.)
These functions check whether a data element is of the corresponding type.
They must take a single argument, but contained in a Haskell list of type `[Val]`,
so that they are compatible with the AST constructor `PrimFunc`.
We already showed you how to implement `symbol?` and `list?` earlier in this document!
Check those out for hints.

  * `symbol?` Checks whether the input is a `Symbol`.

  * `list?` Checks whether a "flattened" version of the list is really a proper list
      (not a dotted list or something else).

  * `pair?` Accepts either proper Scheme lists or dotted lists, nothing else. (Remember,
      in Scheme, both proper lists and dotted lists are technically types of pairs.)
      _However_, an empty list `()` is considered a "null pointer" just like an empty linked list, thus not a pair.

  * `null?` Checks for an empty, proper list.

### Problem 21. Extend the Runtime Library

Now that our evaluator is fully functional, we can implement the following
functions that make use of the evaluator.

``` {.haskell}
-- Primitive function `apply`
-- It applies a function to a list of parameters
-- Examples:
--   (apply + '(1 2 3))  => 6
--   (apply car '((1 2 3)))  => 1
--   (apply (lambda (x) (* 10 x)) '(300)) => 3000
applyPrim :: [Val] -> EvalState Val
applyPrim = undefined
```

``` {.haskell}
-- Primitive function `eval`
-- It evaluates the single argument as an expression
-- All you have to do is to check the number of arguments and
-- feed the single argument to the evaluator!
-- Examples:
--   (eval '(+ 1 2 3))  => 6
evalPrim :: [Val] -> EvalState Val
evalPrim = undefined
```

Now, add these functions to the runtime and test them. 

[^1]: Scheme functions and primitives are *variadic*, which means they operate
    on lists of arguments. That is why `PrimFunc` holds a function of type
    `[Val] -> Val` instead of `Val -> Val -> Val`.

[^2]: Scheme being a simple language to parse does not mean it's not powerful.
    It has exactly the right simplicity to allow very elegant and compact
    specifications.

Testing
----------------------

Aside from the provided testcases, you may want to manually enter the examples
shown above, to observe that everything is working correctly (and for your benefit).

Finally, more cool stuff
-------------------------------

_This section is not graded, but you'll absolutely love it._

Now you have finished the MP! We believe that you've had a lot of fun
implementing Scheme. But the fun doesn't end here--what you have implemented is
merely a subset of Scheme. Try to implement a few tasks below:

1. More parsing capabilities

    * The parser for the current REPL supports one expression per line. But you can
      extend it to accept multiple expressions in a single line.
    * Accepting file inputs will also be an important feature for a real programming language.
    * Comments begin with `;` and continue until the end of the line.

2. Memory model and side effects
   
    The subset of Scheme you've implemented so far is purely functional, but
    Scheme is not a purely functional language. Special form `set!` is used to
    modify a variable. Scheme also has a memory model, which has reference
    semantics. In particular, a closure that captures the environment is treated
    as a "heap object", which gets passed by reference. 
    
    For example, Scheme lets us define a counter without using any global variables:
    
    ```scheme
    scheme> (define my-counter
              (let ((count 0))
                (lambda ()
                  (set! count (+ count 1))
                    count)))
    scheme> (my-counter)
    1
    scheme> (my-counter)
    2
    scheme> (my-counter)
    3
    scheme> (define other-counter my-counter) ;; Assigning reference
    scheme> (other-counter)
    4
    scheme> (other-counter)
    5
    scheme> (my-counter)
    6
    scheme> (other-counter)
    7
    ```
    
    Hint: You'll need to give `Env` an overhaul, simulate pointers (for which you
    might need the `IORef` monad), and properly handle global scoping and lexical
    scoping.
 
3. Higher-order functions
 
    Why not implement `map` and `reduce` in Scheme? Create your own functional
    library in Scheme, store the functions in a file, and load it every time you
    start the REPL.
    
4. Metacircular evaluator
 
    > Data is code. Code is data.
 
    With all the primitive functions that you implemented, did you know you can
    implement a Scheme evaluator in Scheme? Try to implement `eval` directly in
    Scheme!
    
    ```scheme
    scheme> (eval '(+ 1 2 3))
    6
    scheme> (eval '(apply + '(1 2 3)))
    6
    ```
    
    Here's an introduction to the metacircular evaluator in one page:

5. Learn everything else from SICP
 
    **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** is an excellent
    textbook for teaching the principles of programming.
