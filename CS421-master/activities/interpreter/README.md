# interpreter

Here is a quick interpreter activity for you.

This is the code we went over in class.  Your job: make function definitions and application accept
multiple arguments.

You will need to change three constructors (`ClosureVal`, `AppExp`, and `FunExp`), and also the `eval`
clause for `AppExp`.

Use `stack repl` to bring up the prompt and play with `eval`.

Use `stack test` to run some simple test cases.  This one will not compile out of the box; you have to
fix those types first.
